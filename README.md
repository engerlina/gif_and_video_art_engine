# GIF and Video Art Engine 

## Introduction
That's an art engine that will allow u to create spectacular Gifs and Videos generated by overlapping multiple gif or video. The code was created by **me**, by taking ispiration from the one written by Hashlips, that for the moment only supports static images. I created this code to generate my own Gifs and to help others do the same for their projects. 

If you found my work useful for any of your projects, please make some donations to support me. I would really appreaciate that.

These are some GIFs/Videos that people generated with my engine:

## Important notes before starting

- The code was tested with FFmpeg version 4.2.4.

- Each Gif/Video you put as layer should have the same size, length and number of frames of the others. If this condition won't be respected some layers will probably become static after a period of time.

- I'm really sorry if you will find some bugs trying to run the code. If you find some, please open an issue, so i can know what the problem is and i can fix it, in my free time.


## What does the code allow you to do? 
When you have downloaded the code you will be able to generate your own GIFs and Videso using GIFs or Videos as layers. What the code will do is overlay all the GIFs or Videos you have chosen in the desired order and generate _n_ final GIFs or Videos. This is an example of generating a gif with five separate layers:

|Layer number|Layer|Name|Gif|
|------------|-----|----|---|
|1|Background|f8f9f9.gif|![Alt Text](https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_art_engine_for_nft/blob/main/example/f8f9f9.gif)|
|2|Character |zombie-male.gif|![Alt Text](https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_art_engine_for_nft/blob/main/example/zombie-male.gif)|
|3|Head      |tophat.gif|![Alt Text](https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_art_engine_for_nft/blob/main/example/tophat.gif)|
|4|Eyes      |bigshades.gif|![Alt Text](https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_art_engine_for_nft/blob/main/example/bigshades.gif)|
|5|Mouth     |lipstick-party_pink.gif|![Alt Text](https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_art_engine_for_nft/blob/main/example/lipstick-party_pink.gif)|

**Output:**

### What functionality does it offer?

* Generate GIFs/Videos uniquely or not, randomly or by selecting a rarity for each individual layer.

* Generation of a preview GIF containing the first _n_ GIFs generated.

* Modification of JSON (Metadata) after generating the media.

* After generating a collection you will automatically find in the output folder a file called _rarity-list.txt_ that will tell you the actual percentage of presence of each layer in the collection.

* You can combine video and audio files to generate video + audio files.

* If the video files you are trying to overlapping contains an audio track, even this will be overlapped with the others audio traces


## Installation, compilation and execution

**Note:** the code was not tested on macOS, but i know someone succeeded to run this code on macOS

**Requirements:** Windows or Linux operating system

On windows to install the Ubuntu bash/terminal watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ap3hL-UR9I

Then open the terminal and run this three commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ -y
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg -y
```

If you have git installed and you want to clone the project, run this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Goldo02/gif_and_video_art_engine.git
```

After that, open the terminal and move to the folder where you cloned the project.

To compile the _main.cpp_ file use the command: 
```
g++ ./library/dnaGenerator.cpp ./library/metadataFunction.cpp ./library/myFFmpegConversion.cpp ./library/utils.cpp main.cpp -o main
```

To run the code and generate the art with opensea standard metadata:
```
./main ETH 
```

To run the code and generate the art with solana standard metadata:
```
./main SOL
```

To update your metadata following the opensea standard:
```
./main ETH update_info
```

To update your metadata following the solana standard:
```
./main SOL update_info
```

To generate a preview gif:
```
./main ETH preview_gif
```

To combine video with audio:
```
./main ETH combine_video_with_audio
```


**Note:** remember that every time you modify the file you must also recompile it before running it, otherwise you will run the program out of date with the changes you made.

## Usage
To use the algorithm and modify it according to your needs you must open the file _main.cpp_. That's the part of the code to change:
```c++
const int scale = 240;
const string outputFormat = "gif";
const bool randomized = false;
const bool unique = true;
const bool shuffleOutput = true;
vector<int> collectionSize = {10, 4};
const vector<vector<string>> layerDir = 
{
{"1-background", "2-character", "3-head", "4-eyes", "5-lip"},
{"1-background", "2-character", "3-head"}
};

const string name = "SUrrty Peasy YouTube test";
const string description = "i love u";
const string baseUri = "https://twittercom/elonmusk";
const vector<pair<string,string>> extraMetadata = 
{
{"Compiler", "CeloPunks compiler"},
{"Github Author", "Goldo02"}
};
```

Description of variables:

* _scale_: is the output width, the height will be self-determined.

* _outputFormat_: is the format of the output files. If you are operating with GIFs, it should be gif, if u are operating with video should be a video format.

* _randomized_: set this parameter to true if you want the algorithm to choose random raritys, to false if not.

* _unique_: set this parameter to true if you want that each GIF or Video is unique, to false if you want that there is the possibilites that a GIF or a Video appear more than one time.

* _shuffleOutput_: shuffle the final output. Only set this to true if you have sub collections.

* _collectionSize_: contains the number of media u want to generate for each collection. This number is linked to the lines of the _layerDir_ variable.

* _layerDir_: contains the layers to consider for each collection. **You don't need to specify every single layer, but each layers name cannot have spaces, if you want to put spaces in the metadata you hae to put the character '_' instead. The rarity is specified in the single layer name after the '#' character, after this character you can insert the percentage of presence of the trait. This number must be an integer.**

* _name_: is the name of the collection.

* _description_: is the description of the collection.

* _baseUri_: is the place where all your media will be hosted. Usually people host their media on their server or on Pinata IPFS.

* _extraMetadata_: contains some extra metadata you can choose to add at the end of each .json file.

**Remember**: recompile the program before running it after modifying it.

### Update metadata
To update the metadata you need to change this part of the code accordly to your needs, then you need to recompile the code, and then you can execute the code.
```c++
const string name = "SUrrty Peasy YouTube test";
const string description = "i love u";
const string baseUri = "https://twittercom/elonmusk";
const vector<pair<string,string>> extraMetadata = 
{
{"Compiler", "CeloPunks compiler"},
{"Github Author", "Goldo02"}
};
```

There are two commands to update the metadata, you can find them in the **Installation, Build and Run** part of the readme.


### Creating a gif preview
To create a preview gif you need to change this part of the code accordly to your needs, then you need to recompile the code, and then you can execute the code.
Example:
```c++
const int firstMedia = 0;
const int numbOfMediaToGen = 10;
const int fps = 30;
```

Description of variables:

* _firstMedia_: is the position of the first GIF.

* _numbOfMediaToGen_: number of gifs to be considered for preview_gif generation. The first gif will have _firstMedia_ as initial position.

* _fps_: is the encoding speed, choose it according to the fps of your gifs.

This is an example of a user-generated preview_gif:

### Combine video and audio
To create a preview gif you need to change this part of the code accordly to your needs, then you need to recompile the code, and then you can execute the code.
```c++
const int firstMedia = 0;
const int numbOfMediaToGen = 10;
const string inputVideoForm = "mp4";
const string inputAudioForm = "mp3";
const string outputVideoForm = "mp4";
```

All the video and audio you want to combine should be placed in the tmp directory. You will find the output under output/video-with-audio
